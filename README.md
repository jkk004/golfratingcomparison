# "Drive for show, putt for dough"

-A popular saying in golf is "Drive for show and putt for dough". This gave me inspiration to see how golf stats relate to actual performance.

-Used the years from 2001 and up because a lot of these statistics don't have records before 2000.

-Have two seperate files with main (to get the data) and createvisual (to create the visual) because the main portion of getting the data takes more time than just showing the plot with the data. You can always merge the files accordingly, but I preferred splitting them.

-Got the data from web scraping. With my code and the PGA Tour website, you could get rankings with pretty much any statistic, other than putting and driving (which were the two main parameters I wanted to focus on). All you have to do is change the link to scrape towards that statistic. The second link always stays the same, since that is just going through the money leaderboard 

-Only 2 players were out of the top 125, so overall, pretty good showing.

-Recent years have shown that the top driver was highly ranked on the money leaderboard.

-Oddly, a lot of good bunker players are highly rated

-For approach shots 50-125 yards in, the stat was available starting from 2002. Therefore, I had to make some slight changes in my code to get this statistic (not much)
