# "Drive for show, putt for dough"

-Have two seperate files with main (to get the data) and createvisual (to create the visual) because the main portion of getting the data takes more time than just showing the plot with the data. You can always merge the files accordingly, but I preferred splitting them.

-Got the data from web scraping. With my code and the PGA Tour website, you could get rankings with pretty with pretty much any statistic, other than putting and driving (which were the two main parameters I wanted to focus on). All you have to do is change the link to scrape towards that statistic. The second link always stays the same, since that is just going through the money leaderboard 

-Only 2 players were out of the top 125, so overall, pretty good showing.

-For the driving comparison, a lot of the recent long drivers have been consistantly very highly rated on the money leaderboard. Therefore, it is key to note that possibly in recent times, the "Drive for show, putt for dough" has shifted to "Drive for dough AND putt for dough"

-You can do this rating comparison with any stat

-Oddly a seemingly less important stat showed more promise to one's success on tour

-For approach shots 50-125 yards in, the stat was available starting from 2002. Therefore, I had to make some slight changes in my code to get this statistic (not many)
